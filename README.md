# 💡 What is MS SQL Server?
Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database engine developed by Microsoft. It helps businesses efficiently store and manage structured data using SQL (Structured Query Language).

# 🔧 Key Features

⚙️ Scalable: Works for small apps to enterprise-scale systems.
💬 T-SQL Support: Uses Transact-SQL — SQL with added procedural capabilities.
🧩 Integration: Easily integrates with Microsoft tools like SSMS, Visual Studio, and Azure.
🔐 Secure & Compliant: Supports compliance standards like GDPR and PIPEDA.
🏦 Use Case: Spring Financial
Imagine storing and analyzing loan application data using SQL Server — enabling data analysts to query customer details for underwriting, reporting, or risk modeling.

# 🧠 Key Concepts

# 🗃️ Databases
A database is a container that stores related data in tables, along with a defined schema.
